## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the project of predicting cardiovascular diseases using advanced machine learning techniques. The objective is to harness data science for medical diagnostics, with a focus on developing models that offer high predictive accuracy for cardiovascular disease based on various health indicators.

## Data

The project utilizes a composite dataset compiled from two primary sources:

1. [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
2. [Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset by YasserH](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/heart-disease-dataset)

These datasets include numerous health indicators like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/spmfte/cardiovascular-disease-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd cardiovascular-disease-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Execute the Jupyter notebook `cardiovascular_analysis.ipynb` for a detailed walkthrough of the analysis and model development.

2. Customize the code to fit other datasets or to tweak the machine learning models used.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

The Jupyter notebook includes detailed data exploration, visualization, and preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and feature scaling.

## Model Development

Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosted Trees, are developed and fine-tuned to predict cardiovascular diseases.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC to ensure their effectiveness in predicting cardiovascular diseases.
