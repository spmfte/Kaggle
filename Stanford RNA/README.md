## Overview

This repository contains a deep dive into the complexities of RNA sequence prediction. By employing advanced neural network architectures and the extensive dataset provided in the Kaggle challenge, we aim to unveil the mysteries surrounding RNA's behavior and stability.

## Model Architecture and Data Augmentation

The architecture is meticulously crafted to cater to the peculiarities of RNA sequences. It uses a combination of 1D convolutional layers and recurrent layers to capture both spatial and temporal features in the sequences.

Data augmentation techniques, such as random noise introduction and sequence flipping, are implemented to diversify the dataset, making the model more resilient.

The mathematical representation of the model:

Let \( X \) be the input sequence of shape \( (L, C) \) where \( L \) is the length of the sequence and \( C \) is the number of channels (sequence features).

The forward pass is represented as:

$$
\begin{align*}
X_1 &= \text{ReLU}(\text{BN}(\text{Conv1D}(X, W_1))) \\
X_2 &= \text{LSTM}(X_1, W_2) \\
X_3 &= \text{Dropout}(X_2) \\
Y &= \text{Softmax}(\text{FC}(X_3, W_3))
\end{align*}
$$

Where:
- Conv1D: 1D Convolution operation
- BN: Batch Normalization
- ReLU: Rectified Linear Unit activation function
- LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory layer
- FC: Fully Connected layer
- Dropout: Dropout regularization
- Softmax: Softmax activation function
- W_i: Learnable weights for each layer

## Training Process

Detailed training metrics, learning rates, and loss curves can be found in the Jupyter Notebook. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate annealing schedule. Early stopping was implemented to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation

The evaluation metrics and validation scores, as well as a comparison with other methods and models, will be highlighted in this section.

## Generating Output

The trained model is used to predict the reactivity, degradation, and other features for the RNA sequences in the test set. The predictions are then processed and saved in the format required for Kaggle submission.

## Conclusion

Conclusive remarks on the project's achievements, its significance in the domain of RNA research, and potential future directions.

## Challenges

RNA sequence prediction posed several unique challenges, such as:
- Handling the diverse and non-uniform length of RNA sequences.
- Predicting multiple features simultaneously while maintaining accuracy.
- Mitigating overfitting due to the high dimensionality of the data.
- Interpreting the model's predictions in a biologically meaningful way.
