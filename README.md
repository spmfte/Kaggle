Welcome to my Kaggle repository, where I showcase my deep dives into various datasets and challenges. Here, you'll find a blend of cutting-edge machine learning models, data analysis, and creative solutions.

## Projects

### 1. Vesuvius Challenge
**Description**: An in-depth approach to detecting ink in ancient manuscripts using convolutional neural networks.
