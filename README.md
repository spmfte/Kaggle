Welcome to my Kaggle repository, where I showcase my deep dives into various datasets and challenges. Here, you'll find a blend of cutting-edge machine learning models, data analysis, and creative solutions.

## Projects

### 1. Vesuvius Challenge
- **Description**: An in-depth approach to detecting ink in ancient manuscripts using convolutional neural networks.
- [Project Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/colewelkins/give-me-words)
- [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection/)
- [Related Paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215775)

### 2. RNA Kaggle Challenge
- **Description**: Predicting RNA sequence behavior using advanced neural network architectures to unravel the mysteries surrounding RNA's behavior and stability.
- [Project Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/colewelkins/mlrna)
- [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine)
- [Related Paper](TODO)


## Key Achievements

- Succesfully read scrolls in the Vesuvius Challenge using a custom 3D convolutional neural network.
- Successfully predicted RNA behavior with an accuracy of TBD% in the RNA Kaggle Challenge.
